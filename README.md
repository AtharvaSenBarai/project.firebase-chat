# exercise.firebase-chat

In this project, you'll create a chatroom using Firebase as the backend.

[Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) is a database with a few nifty features:
  * You can use it entirely from client side Javascript.
  * It's designed to handle synchronizing data between multiple users.Changes to the database are broadcast to all connected clients in real time (think Google Docs).
  * It stores structured, JSON-like data.
  * It's run as a web service. That means it's someone else's problem if it breaks.

These features make it great for implementing a chat room.

## Learning Goals ##
  * Become comfortable with Javascript events and callbacks.
  * Understand how NoSQL databases work.
  * Understand how well defined protocols help interoperability.
  * Learn about modular, testable Javascript.

## Setup: Make your repo and create a Firebase account ##

Fork this repo. Don't simply branch it. The reason I'm asking you to do things
this way is that by forking it, you'll be able to easily host your project on
Github Pages

Go [create a firebase account](https://www.firebase.com/account), and [go through the 5-minute tutorial](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/).


## The chat room protocol ##

Your chat room clients will push their messages into a Firebase database.
Firebase will handle syncing the messages between clients. If we decide on a
message format, then your chat room client will be able to connect to anyone's
Firebase. Your clients will be interoperableâ€”it won't matter if you're using
my code or yours, we'll still be able to talk to each other.

So let's do that.

### Message Format ###

Two fields are mandatory:

    ts: number,  the message reached the database in
        milliseconds since the UNIX epoch
    user: string, the username of the user sending the message

All other fields are optional. To allow for extensibility, chat rooms must
not break when they encounter fields they do not understand.

There is no limit on the size of a message, except those imposed by Firebase.

Optional fields:

    msg: string, the text of a message from the user to the room
