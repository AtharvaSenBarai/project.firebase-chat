# exercise.firebase-chat

In this project, you'll create a chatroom using Firebase as the backend.

[Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) is a database with a few nifty features:
  * You can use it entirely from client side Javascript.
  * It's designed to handle synchronizing data between multiple users.Changes to the database are broadcast to all connected clients in real time (think Google Docs).
  * It stores structured, JSON-like data.
  * It's run as a web service. That means it's someone else's problem if it breaks.

These features make it great for implementing a chat room.

## Learning Goals ##
  * Become comfortable with Javascript events and callbacks.
  * Understand how NoSQL databases work.
  * Understand how well defined protocols help interoperability.
